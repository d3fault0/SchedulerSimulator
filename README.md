# SchedulerSimulator

This is a small program I developed to introduce some specific concepts of design patterns and python programming.
It simulates a basic process scheduler behaviour in the OS.
It uses multiple threads to enforce the idea that different components must interact with each other.

## More Info
* Take a look at SchedulerSimulator.pdf to get a better grasp of how this was designed.
